# How can I contribute?

Well, this is my **personal** configuration for Neovim that I'm sharing online to inspire others and perhaps receive suggestions.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to either create an issue or submit a pull request with all the setup in place.

Will I accept it? That will ultimately be my decision.
